# Obstacle and Pit Avoidance System

This project implements an autonomous navigation system for robots, with a core focus on **obstacle avoidance** and **pit detection** through the power of computer vision and point cloud processing.

---

### Key Features

1. **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:**
    - Uses point cloud data from **Intel RealSense D455**, which is analyzed using the **PCL (Point Cloud Library)** to detect obstacles.
    - Real-time navigation adjustments to steer clear of obstacles.
	
2. **Pit Detection:** Robots are enabled to locate sharp terrain drop, sudden mis-depth declayout error ground handing drops optional.\
